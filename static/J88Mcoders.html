		<h1>Coding for us</h1>
		Coding for a project is not the same as coding for a university assignment. We have certain expectations and requirements.
<ul>
<li>Experienced with OOP or functional programming
<li>Good knowledge of at least one powerful interpreted language*
<li>Willingness and ability to self-learn concepts
<li>Good and open communication.
<li>Intuition for secure, modular, flexible code
</ul>

<blockquote>*(Lua, Python, JavaScript etc) - Basically you should be comfortable with functions as first class objects, hashmaps/objects/tables (They are called different things in different languages), callback programming, event driven programming, prototype inheritence etc.
If you donâ€™t know some of those topics, research and see if you understand them.
</blockquote>

<p>
If you wish to contribute to this project, you will have to code in a language called <a href="http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/">Lua.</a><br />

Lua is a very easy to learn language, and a quick learner will have no problems understanding it, especially if they are used to Python/JavaScript etc. (Lua has less features though)<br />

</p>
<p>
I do not expect candidates to know all these topics already. If you are talented then you may be able to understand these concepts with some research and some help.<br />

However, this is not a training project. Above average aptitude is required.
