summary : bakaGaijin is an open source (MIT License) library that allows seamless cross resource communication across Lua virtual machines in MTA. It allows you to pass functions, tables (by reference), and such complex types that the C interface is not actually capable of sending. It is implemented in pure Lua.

I had the wonderful opportunity to intern at IIT Bombay to help develop the Image Processing Toolbox for Scilab, a free software developed by French company Scilab Enterprises. I got this opportunity as a member of FOSSEE (Free Open Source Software For Education), an initiative by IIT Bombay to make available open source equivalents of proprietary academic software.

 I had worked with a team of 6-7 interns from different colleges across India. We worked under professor Kannan M Moudgalya, and my immidiate mentor miss Shamika.

 My duties were primarily related to interfacing C with Scilab to call native OpenCV functions for Scilab operations, to ensure that the exposed functions follow the project guidelines regarding syntax and signatures (This involved a lot of code refactoring and migration, for which I was required to build automatic tools), and to build tools to run unit tests on these functions.

 I will describe my experiences (and the software I wrote) in more detail on a dedicated page, which is under construction.
