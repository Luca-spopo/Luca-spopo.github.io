		<h1>Designing for us</h1>
		<p>
		Projects like these require graphic assets. We would require logos, icons, interfaces etc.<br>
		There are also UI / UX components that would need design and insight.<br>
		At the very least, we need a logo. The name of the project is Nimbus, which is a type of cloud.<br>
		</p>
		<p>If you are interested, then send a rough draft of a logo to me at katoch.anirudh(at)gmail(dot)com. If it's great, I would love for you to develop it further.</p>
