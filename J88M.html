		<h1>Welcome</h1>
		<p>
			You probably got here because you are interested in a multiplayer RPG gamemode for Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas
		</p><hrr />
		<p>
			<blockquote>How do you do it?</blockquote>
			Some very talented people made a modification for GTA:SA called MTA that let's people play the game multiplayer.<br />
			Furthermore, they provide hooks to let the server hosts add functionality to the game by running Lua code.<br />
			Have a look at their website: https://www.mtasa.com/
		</p><hrr />
		<p>
			<blockquote>What are you making?</blockquote>
			"We" are me (Luca aka Anirudh Katoch, India), Carmelo (Italy) and Victor (Brazil).<br />

We are making a server that would allow players to engage in "real-life"-like gameplay scenario, with roles, events and specific situations they can freely adhere to.<br>

Players would be required to make a character. The state and information of the character is saved across each play.<br>

For example, a player that leans towards police-type activities actually becomes a cop, and receives the power and freedom to arrest criminals, investigate crimes, intercept vehicle chases or even stop a bank robbery.<br>

Criminals may team up with other criminals, commit robberies, join a gang, and conquer their own turfs / neighborhoods.<br>

Players who lean more towards civilian activities mainly engage in economy-oriented work, develop their own businesses and strive to grow in influence within the server economy.<br>

Previous servers have always either stuck to the "way too simple and primitive", or the
"deep, yet overly complex" format. Here, we are going for something new : Attempting to get the best of both, and making something deep, with extreme freedom, and at the same time, easy to pick up and understand.<br>

That's right. You choose and build your own path.<br>

			The server would be free to play, and making money is not our aim.<br />

			I think you can imagine the kind of gameplay we are aiming for. We call it RPG, or light roleplay.
