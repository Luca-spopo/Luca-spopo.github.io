		<h1>Welcome</h1>
		<p>
			You probably got here because you are interested in a multiplayer RPG gamemode for Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas
		</p><hr />
		<p>
			<h3>How do you do it?</h3>
			Some very talented people made a modification for GTA:SA called MTA that let's people play the game multiplayer.<br />
			Furthermore, they provide hooks to let the server hosts add functionality to the game by running Lua code.<br />
			Have a look at their website: https://www.mtasa.com/
		</p><hr />
		<p>
			<h3>What are you making?</h3>
			"We" are me (Luca aka Anirudh Katoch, India), Carmelo (Italy) and Victor (Brazil).<br />
			We are making a server that would allow players to engage in light roleplay, while still being fast paced and action packed. Our focus would be on "fun", but players would have roles they need to adhere to.<br /><br />

			Players would be required to make a character. The state of the character will be saved across plays.<br /><br />
			
			For example, a player that is a police officer must arrest players that are playing as criminals.<br />
			A player that is a criminal may choose to join a gang.<br />
			Different gangs are obliged to engage in turf wars.<br />
			Players that have taken the role of a mechanic will have the ability to repair cars, but not the ability to arrest criminals.
			Et cetera.<br /><br />

			The server will have its own economy, and making virtual money would be an important part of the game. There would be items, and an inventory system. There would be factions, gangs, perhaps mafia, police units, civilian companies, etc.<br /><br />

			Players will be able to own cars, houses, etc.<br /><br />

			Randomly killing each other for no reason would be discouraged.<br /><br />

			The server would be free to play, and making money is not our aim.<br /><br />

			I think you can imagine the kind of gameplay we are aiming for. We call it RPG, or light roleplay.
