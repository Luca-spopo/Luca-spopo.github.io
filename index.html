<xmp theme="cyborg">About me
========
I'm Anirudh Katoch, an undergraduate student at Manipal Institute of Technology, Manipal. Currently persuing a
B.Tech in Information Technology.  
I have a passion for creating things and solving problems (in equal parts). I have found that I am best suited for
creating through technology.  
Some people prefer to call me Luca, which is my online handle.

Use the navigation bar above to view my projects or portfolio.

>Hobbies?

singing, coding, thinking, sleeping, anime, manga

I am also interested in math, physics, reading and writing.  
But I've not invested enough time in them to be able to call them hobbies.  
_I'll find the time eventually._

>Vices?

Coffee addict

>Favourite book?

I haven't read a lot of books, but Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy was great.

>Introvert or Extrovert?

Highly adaptable.

>Dream job?

One that lets me be creative and helps me grow.

>Stengths?

This may sound funny but I think I'm good at _thinking_.

>Weakness?

Most of my personal projects have had no time bound, so I have used them as learning oppurtunities, instead of
aiming to complete them.

i.e. _overengineering_

>Work hard or work smart?

No reason not to do both.

>What if you won the lottery?

Invest and grow. Life is like farmville.

>Tell me everything

(TL;DR)<sup>-1</sup>
-----------
My early childhood revolved around extreme boredom, video games and the internet. Imagine a summer vacation, now
imagine feeling that way for a few years. This extreme boredom played out in my favour as I developed a habit of
thinking. My thoughts would wander to all sorts of subjects as my tiny brain tried to figure out how telephones are
possible at all, why the sky isn't falling, and all the other questions you would have the first time you encounter
~~PHP~~ life. I did not get the answers to my questions until much later in life, but I believe the process of asking
the questions was much more impactful on my development than getting the answers.

Just as reading a good book fills some people with the desire to write, playing certain wonderful video games filled
me with a desire to make them. I would fill notebooks with content about my favourite games, and ideas on how to
expand on them. Perhaps I had a slight compulsion for documenting things in general, or maybe I was just bored. 
(Speaking of which, I also religiously recorded all the pokemon songs on a tape recorder, I probably did have a thing
for documenting.)

At the onset of teenage I shifted to New Delhi. My social circle got a lot larger there. As I grew older and figured
out how the internet works, I was introduced to Macromedia FlashMX by chance. ActionScript 2 was my third language
after Hindi and English. An embarassing number of years were then spent teaching myself how to code trivial things.
I also picked up ActionScript 3 later on. I was also introduced to various forums, and this was my gateway to
internet culture.

Eventually I stumbled upon [MTA](https://github.com/multitheftauto), a fan made, open source multiplayer mod for GTA
San Andreas that provides hooks to alter every aspect of gameplay. I joined one of the roleplay servers and then
there is a long, tangential story of how I ended up leading an online clan (Which is somehow still alive), and then
become a moderator, and a Lua programmer. As a staff member on an online persistent world multiplayer server with
lots of rivals, I learnt a lot about administration, networking, databases, software architecture, project
management, bug tracking, hacking, crisis management and damage control. I also fell in love with Lua, which is still
my language of choice.

Fast forward a few years and the 11th grade school curriculum introduced me to (a very old standard of) C++. Working
on a lower level of abstraction really cleared my concepts about computers. It made me appriciate and fully
understand higher level features such as closures, type systems, runtime checking, complex types being abstracted as
objects, garbage collection, and all those things under the hood.

Around the same time, I first started using Linux. I learnt basic bash scripting and set up tiny (but useful) scripts
that used cron to send my Minecraft server's IP to a list of friends (Before I knew how easy setting up a DDNS was),
or remotely used the webcam to make sure things are still OK in the house while we were on vacation. The scripts were
barely a few dozen lines long, thanks to the plathora of wonderful tools and abstractions available, but the
experience of gluing them together and applying them to real world problems was very educational. Eventually I would
start browsing the [Arch wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/) and pick up all sorts of Linux trivia.

After that I entered college, and that is where this story `yeild`s. I have met some amazing people here. My
roommates are a math/physics buff + mad guitarist Arjit Seth, and writing prodigy + very sane guitarist Rahul Basu. I
also networked and worked with some amazing people at [IECSE](https://www.iecsemanipal.com/). I spent some very
memorable weeks interning with some insanely talented people at IIT Bombay under [FOSSEE](http://fossee.in/). I spent many sleepless
nights writing code for [bakaGaijin](projects.html) and [Ash](projects.html). I learnt how to perfectly and crisply iron a shirt (among more
technical things) during my [HP]() internship. I have also collected a lot of [anime](anime.log) at this point.

If you actually read all of that then I applaud your patience.  
Maybe you want to read about my [creations](projects.html)? Or perhaps [contact me](contact.html)? Or have a look at
a more formal and descriptive [portfolio](portfolio.html)?
